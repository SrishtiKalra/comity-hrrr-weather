## 1. How long did you spend working on the problem? What difficulties, if any, did you run into along the way?

I spent roughly 4.5 hours (split between breaks during Saturday night and Sunday evening) working on the task.

One of the challenges was working with the GRIB2 file format. The HRRR dataset contains a lot of variables, and the names in the files don’t always line up with the “human-readable” names in the instructions. For example, what the challenge called surface_pressure sometimes appears in the GRIB files under a different label like mean sea-level pressure (MSLP). I had to dig into the GRIB index with pygrib to figure out which combination of shortName, typeOfLevel, and level actually corresponded to each required variable.

Another hurdle was getting the command-line interface right with Typer. At first, I mistakenly set it up so that points.txt looked like a subcommand instead of a required argument. This meant the tool wouldn’t run the way the instructions described. I ended up restructuring the CLI so that the points.txt file is a true positional argument and added the proper typer.run(main) entrypoint. After that, the CLI matched the spec and worked with the hrrr-ingest points.txt --options style of invocation.

Finally, I spent time ensuring the solution was idempotent. If you run the ingestion twice with the same arguments, you don’t want duplicate rows piling up in the database. To prevent that, I made the insert routine in DuckDB check for existing rows based on forecast time, location, and variable. I used a small trick with an anti-join insert in db.py so that only genuinely new rows are added. This way, re-runs are safe, and the database stays clean.

## 2. Please list any AI assistants you used to complete your solution, along with a description of how you used them.

I used ChatGPT and Github copilot while working on the solution. I started with a rough skeleton of the CLI and asked it to help shape it into something that matched the problem spec, specifically the hrrr-ingest points.txt --options style the challenge required. 

I also used it a lot while mapping variables: I’d run pygrib locally, paste in the raw inspection output, and then work with the assistant to figure out which (shortName, typeOfLevel, level) combo actually matched the human-readable names like dewpoint_2m or relative_humidity_2m.

It was also really useful for debugging. I used AI to understand how Typer interprets arguments, and from there we restructured the CLI so it behaved correctly. And I also discussed ways to make sure the solution was idempotent where the anti-join insert solution made sense to me so that only rows not already present go in the database. 

It really helped things speed up. I still had to do all the hands-on validation with the data and DuckDB, but the assistant acted like a sounding board for code structure, error messages, and documentation.

## 3. How would you deploy your solution as a production service?

In production, I’d package the tool as a Docker container so it’s easy to deploy in different environments. The ingestion would be triggered daily right after the NOAA 06z HRRR run is available, scheduled with Kubernetes CronJob. 

For storage, I’d move beyond DuckDB and use a columnar format like Parquet on S3, partitioned by run date, forecast hour, and variable. That would make the data efficient to query with engines like Spark. Analysts and researchers could then plug directly into S3-backed tables without needing to pull raw GRIB files.

For monitoring, I’d log ingestion status, row counts per run, and time coverage, and push those metrics into something like Prometheus + Grafana. Alerts would fire if an expected HRRR run is delayed or if record counts drop below a threshold (suggesting a parsing issue). This way, we’d have confidence both in the pipeline running on schedule and in the correctness of the ingested dataset.

## 4.  How would you scale it up to support large-scale backfills of many data points across years worth of data?

If I needed to backfill years of HRRR data instead of a single run date, I’d approach it like this:

Parallel ingestion:
Instead of looping through hours sequentially, I’d use a workflow tool (Airflow, Prefect, or even a simple job queue) to launch parallel workers that each handle a subset of dates/hours.

Storage format:
Move from DuckDB to columnar storage (Parquet/Arrow) on S3 or cloud storage, partitioned by run date, forecast hour, and variable. This makes querying and backfills much faster and more scalable.

Query layer:
Analysts could query the partitioned dataset using Athena/Trino/Spark, while DuckDB would still be handy for smaller, local analysis.

Performance improvements:
- Avoid repeatedly downloading GRIB files (use local caching or shared storage).
- Use efficient GRIB readers (cfgrib/xarray) and index-based selection instead of brute-force parsing with pygrib.
- Batch inserts/writes instead of row-by-row.

Long-term scalability:
With this setup, the system could handle many terabytes of forecasts, and re-running backfills across years would just be a matter of scaling out workers.
